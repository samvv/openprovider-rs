OpenProvider.nl in Rust
=======================

This is an implementation of a spec-compliant HTTP-based API client for the
OpenProvider.nl domain reseller.

**⚠️ Right now only a small subset of the OpenProvider API is supported, but 
with most groundwork being done it should be easy to integrate whatever
endpoint you need.**
